- [ ] Performance testing

### Documentation
- [ ] Component API documentation
- [ ] State management flow documentation
- [ ] Error handling guidelines
- [ ] Style guide documentation

### Performance
- [ ] Component render optimization
- [ ] State update optimization
- [ ] Bundle size analysis
- [ ] Load time improvements

### Future Enhancements
- [ ] Component library extraction
- [ ] Additional vote visualization options
- [ ] Enhanced error reporting
- [ ] Performance monitoring tools

## Evolution of Decisions

### Architecture
1. Initial Implementation
   - Single large component
   - Inline styles
   - Mixed concerns

2. Current Implementation
   - Modular components
   - CSS modules
   - Custom hooks
   - Clear separation of concerns

### State Management
1. Initial Approach
   - Multiple useState hooks
   - Complex state updates
   - Prop drilling

2. Current Approach
   - Custom hooks
   - Centralized state
   - Efficient updates
   - Type-safe implementation

### Styling
1. Initial Implementation
   - Inline styles
   - Mixed styling patterns
   - Style duplication

2. Current Implementation
   - CSS modules
   - Consistent patterns
   - Reusable styles
   - Clean component interfaces

## Known Issues
None currently - major refactoring has addressed previous technical debt

## Test Data Guidelines
- Never use real names from example files in test data
- Always create fictional names and email addresses for test data
- Randomize voter IDs in test data
- Maintain realistic data patterns while using fictional information

## Next Steps Priority

### High Priority
1. Add comprehensive testing
2. Complete component documentation
3. Implement performance monitoring

### Medium Priority
1. Optimize bundle size
2. Enhance error reporting
3. Improve load times

### Low Priority
1. Extract component library
2. Add visualization options
3. Enhance monitoring tools

## Recent Milestones
