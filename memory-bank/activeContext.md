### Current Component Structure
- TabNavigation: Main navigation and tab management
- MembersTab: Member data management
- PollsTab: Vote processing and display
- AliasesTab: Alias management
- VoteSummary: Vote statistics visualization
- AliasModal: Alias creation interface

### Active Patterns
1. Component Organization
   - Each component has a single responsibility
   - Clear separation between UI and logic
   - Consistent prop interfaces
   - Modular CSS styling

2. State Management
   - useVoteProcessing hook for vote-related state
   - useAliases hook for alias management
   - Centralized error handling
   - Efficient state updates

3. Styling Approach
   - Component-specific CSS modules
   - Consistent naming conventions
   - Responsive design patterns
   - Reusable style variables

## Current Focus
- Maintaining clean component boundaries
- Ensuring type safety across components
- Optimizing state updates
- Improving error handling
- Maintaining consistent styling
- Enhancing user experience for multi-poll navigation
- Ensuring robust parsing of complex CSV formats

## Recent Learnings
1. Component Design
   - Breaking down large components improves maintainability
   - Custom hooks help separate concerns
   - CSS modules prevent style conflicts
   - Type safety catches errors early

2. State Management
   - Centralized state management simplifies updates
   - Custom hooks improve code reuse
   - Careful state updates prevent unnecessary rerenders
   - Clear state flow improves debugging

3. Error Handling
   - Consistent error message format
   - User-friendly error displays
   - Proper error propagation
   - Type-safe error handling

4. Multi-Poll Support
   - Tab-like sidebar navigation improves usability for multiple polls
   - Robust parsing of multiple polls from a single CSV file
   - Handling poll names with commas in quotes
   - Validating all polls from "Launched Polls" section are found
   - Maintaining poll context when displaying results
   - Enhanced vote statistics visualization with color-coded metrics
   - Test-driven development for new features

## Next Steps
1. Show all votes
- We want to click on the big valid, invalid, or duplicate votes, or even total votes, and see all votes in a table. Instead of just having an expandy bit for invalid votes

2. A way to remember an invalid person, and stop prompting.


3. Test Data
   - Never use real names from example files in test data
   - Always create fictional names and email addresses for test data
   - Randomize voter IDs in test data

## Active Decisions
1. Component Structure
   - Keep components focused and small
   - Use TypeScript for type safety
   - Maintain clear component interfaces
   - Follow consistent naming patterns

2. State Management
   - Use custom hooks for related state
   - Keep state updates efficient
   - Maintain clear state flow
   - Handle errors gracefully

3. Styling
   - Use CSS modules for component styles
   - Maintain consistent naming
   - Follow responsive design patterns
   - Use design system variables

## Current Challenges
1. Technical
   - Ensuring efficient state updates
   - Maintaining type safety
   - Managing component complexity
   - Optimizing performance

2. Process
   - Maintaining code consistency
   - Documenting changes
   - Maintaining test coverage as features evolve
   - Code review process

## Project Insights
1. Architecture
   - Component-based structure works well
   - Custom hooks improve maintainability
   - CSS modules prevent style conflicts
   - Clear state management is crucial

2. Development
   - TypeScript catches errors early
   - Modular components are easier to maintain
   - Clear patterns improve development speed
   - Good documentation is essential

3. Future Considerations
