- Improved component resilience for zero-value states

### Current Component Structure
- TabNavigation: Main navigation and tab management
- MembersTab: Member data management
- PollsTab: Vote processing and display
- AliasesTab: Alias management
- VoteSummary: Vote statistics visualization
- AliasModal: Alias creation interface

### Active Patterns
1. Component Organization
   - Each component has a single responsibility
   - Clear separation between UI and logic
   - Consistent prop interfaces
   - Modular CSS styling

2. State Management
   - useVoteProcessing hook for vote-related state
   - useAliases hook for alias management
   - Centralized error handling
   - Efficient state updates

3. Styling Approach
   - Component-specific CSS modules
   - Consistent naming conventions
   - Responsive design patterns
   - Reusable style variables
